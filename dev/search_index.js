The scatterplot is most useful for displaying the relationship between two continuous variables.

This can severely distort the visual appearance of the plot. There is no one solution to this problem, but there are some techniques that can help. You can add additional information with geomsmooth(), or if you have few unique x values, geomboxplot() may also be useful. Another technique is to make the points transparent (e.g. geompoint(alpha = 0.05)) or very small (e.g. geompoint(shape = '.')).\n\nRequired Aesthetics\n\nx\ny\n\nOptional Aesthetics (see aes)\n\ncolor / colour\nfill\nshape\nsize\nstroke\n\nOptional Arguments\n\ncolor / colour\ncolormap / palette\nmarker / shape\nmarkersize / size\nstrokewidth / stroke\nstrokecolor / strokecolour\nglowwidth / glow\nglowcolor / glowcolour\nalpha\n\nExamples\n\npenguins = penguins_data();\n\np = ggplot(penguins, @aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm))\np + geom_point()\n\n# add aesthetic mappings\np + geom_point(aes(colour = :sex))\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"reference/#TidierPlots.geom_pointrange-Tuple","page":"Reference","title":"TidierPlots.geom_pointrange","text":"geom_pointrange(aes(...), ...)\ngeom_pointrange(plot::GGPlot, aes(...), ...)\n\nDisplays a point with a vertical line from ymin to ymax.\n\nArguments\n\nplot::GGPlot (optional): a plot object to add this geom to\naes(...): the names of the columns in the DataFrame that will be used in the mapping\n...: options that are not mapped to a column\n\nRequired Aesthetics\n\nx\ny\nymin\nymax\n\nOptional Aesthetics (see aes)\n\ncolor / colour\n\nOptional Arguments\n\ncolor / colour\nlinewidth\nsize / markersize\nalpha\n\nExamples\n\ndf = DataFrame(\n    x = [1, 2, 3, 4],\n    y = [2, 3, 2.5, 3.5],\n    ymin = [1, 2, 1.5, 2.5],\n    ymax = [3, 4, 3.5, 4.5]\n)\n\nggplot(df, @aes(x = x, y = y, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax)) + geom_pointrange()\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"reference/#TidierPlots.geom_rainclouds","page":"Reference","title":"TidierPlots.geom_rainclouds","text":"geom_rainclouds(aes(...), ...)\ngeom_rainclouds(plot::GGPlot, aes(...), ...)\n\n\"Raincloud\" plots are a combination of a (half) violin plot, box plot and scatter plots.

This currently just means that TidierPlots.jl gives the option for specifying aes with the macro @es to allow unquoted column references, but the use of macros may need to expand as more features are added.\nStay as compatible as possible with Makie.jl This package is meant  to be a thin wrapper around Makie's SpecApi syntax to help introduce R users to plotting in  Julia.\nTo Extend ggplot using julia-specific features where appropriate as long as this does  not confict with the first two goals. The package aims to behave exactly like ggplot  unless told otherwise. Additional options and parameters that are not present in ggplot  may be added, but options that are present in R's ggplot should behave the way they do in R.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"For the \"stable\" version, access the Pkg interface by pressing ] at the julia> prompt, then type add TidierPlots.\n\nFor the development version, enter package mode, then:\n\nadd https://github.com/TidierOrg/TidierPlots.jl.git\n\nTidierPlots will also be installed automatically if you add Tidier.","category":"section"},{"location":"#What-functions-does-TidierPlots.jl-support?","page":"Home","title":"What functions does TidierPlots.jl support?","text":"TidierPlots.jl currently supports the top-level function ggplot(), plus:\n\nGeoms:\n\nBar plots: geom_bar, geom_col, geom_histogram\nPoints: geom_point, geom_jitter\nLines: geom_path, geom_line, geom_step, geom_smooth\nReference lines: geom_hline, geom_vline, geom_segment\nErrors and ranges: geom_errorbar, geom_errorbarh, geom_linerange, geom_pointrange\nAreas: geom_area, geom_ribbon\nDistributions: geom_boxplot, geom_violin, geom_density, geom_rainclouds\nContours: geom_contour, geom_contour_filled, geom_density_2d, geom_density_2d_filled\nShapes: geom_tile, geom_rect, geom_polygon\nText: geom_text, geom_label\n\nMakie Themes:\n\ntheme_ggplot2() (the default)\ntheme_dark()\ntheme_black()\ntheme_light()\ntheme_minimal()\n\nScales:\n\nscale_[x|y]_[continuous|log[ |2|10]|logit|pseudolog10|sqrt|reverse]\nscale_color_manual() - set values = c(c1, c2, c3, ...), accepts anything that can be parsed as a color by Colors.jl (named colors, hex values, etc.)\nscale_color_[discrete|continuous|binned]() - set palette = a ColorSchemes.jl palette as a string or symbol.

The only difference in basic usage is in the aes() function. TidierPlots.jl accepts two forms for aes specification, neither of which is exactly the same as ggplot2.\n\nOption 1: aes function, julia-style columns, e.g. aes(x = :x, y = :y) or aes(:x, :y)\nOption 2: @aes (or @es) macro, aes as in ggplot, e.g. @aes(x = x, y = y) or @aes(x, y)\n\nIf you use Option 1, functions can be applied to columns with the => operator to form a Pair{Symbol, Function}, similar to how DataFrames.jl functions work.\n\nmy_fn(x) = x ./ 10\n\ngeom_point(aes(x = :x => my_fn))\n\nFunctions can take multiple columns as input. The following geom_point specification results in x / y (where x and y are the names of columns in a DataFrame) being plotted as the x axis of the graph:\n\nmy_new_fn(x, y) = x ./ y\n\ngeom_point(aes(x = [:x, :y] => my_new_fn))\n\nWith Option 2, functions will be interpreted using TidierData.jl:\n\n# Macro aes equivalents to the above examples\ngeom_point(@aes(x = x / 10))\ngeom_point(@aes(x = x / y))","category":"section"},{"location":"#Why-would-I-use-this-instead-of-ggplot2?","page":"Home","title":"Why would I use this instead of ggplot2?","text":"Right now, you probably wouldn't.
